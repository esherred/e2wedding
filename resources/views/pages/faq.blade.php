      <h3>Are kids invited to the wedding?</h3>
      <p>We want everyone to be able to come to the wedding. This is an adult event, but not strictly an adults-only event. We'd prefer the little ones stay home, but it is much more important to us that everyone invited gets to attend. If you are unsure about childcare or possibly interested in a joint-babysitter, please let us know and we will be happy to put you in contact with other parents.</p>

      <h3>What is the dress code?</h3>
      <p>We love all of you and are far more concerned about your attendance than your attire. While the bridal party will be strictly formal, and we encourage you all to have fun dressing up, if dresses or ties are not your thing, we understand. The wedding is entirely inside, so no need to worry (much) about weather or temperature.</p>

      <h3>Will I need transportation?</h3>
      <p>The Seelbach has a free airport shuttle that should take care of all your wedding-related transportation needs. It picks up at the airport every 30 minutes (7:00 AM, 7:30 AM, etc.) and departs the hotel on the ¼ hour (7:15 AM, 7:45 AM, etc.). The shuttle is in service between 7:00 AM and 11:30 PM.  It is best to make reservations to ensure a seat by calling (502) 585-9252 Ext 206. The shuttle pick-up is located across from the taxi pick-up at the airport. The Seelbach Hilton shuttle is white with the blue Hilton logo on it.</p>
      <p>The wedding itself is just a few blocks from the hotel and therefore no transportation should be necessary, although taxis are available if needed.</p>
      
      <h3>When is the RSVP deadline?</h3>
      <p>NOW! Or, you know, by August 1st would be wonderful! But really since you are here <a href="/rsvp">RSVP now</a>.</p>

      <h3>Will you be accommodating my [insert dietary restriction here]?</h3>
      <p>Due to the nature of our plated dinner, if we know IN ADVANCE about food allergies or restrictions, we will be able to accomodate you. Many of you have let us know about this already, thank you! For anyone who has not and would like to eat at the wedding, please either let Erica know or fill out the Save the Date form. If you tell us the day of the wedding, we will not be able to accomodate you!</p>

      <h3>Are there any local places you’d recommend I visit while I’m in town?</h3>
      <p>Yes! You can see them <a href="/things-to-do">here</a>!</p>

      <h3>Is breakfast served at the hotel?</h3>
      <p>The Seelbach does have a breakfast, but it is not complementary. You can check out their menu <a href="http://www.seelbachhilton.com/downloads/gatsby-breakfast.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p>That said, there is also a Starbucks in the lobby as well as a local and magically delicious coffee shop called Heine Brothers literally across the street from the hotel. They are closed on Sunday but if you’re looking for coffee any other day, we both recommend it over the Starbucks.</p>

      <h3>Do you have a registry?</h3>
      <p>We do. We decided to a "honeyfund" concept, which you can find <a href="/registry">here</a>. However if you are looking for a more traditional registry we did put together some items on an <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/wedding/erica-rodgers-eric-sherred-louisville-september-2018/registry/2CDV3GY6PZ5F4" target="_blank">Amazon registery</a>.</p>

      <h3>Louisville Weather</h3>
      <p>Average high of 84.</p>
      <p>Average low of 64.</p>
      <p>Louisville can get muggy in the summer, but we’re hoping an early fall will ward that off.</p>
