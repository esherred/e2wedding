        <h5>Urban Bourbon Trail</h5>
        <p>For anyone with the time, we have been enjoying the <a href="https://www.bourboncountry.com/things-to-do/urban-bourbon-trail/" target="_blank">Urban Bourbon Trail</a> (go to a listed bar, buy a drink, get a stamp. Repeat.) Booklets for this are available in the Seelbach bar as well as the very closeby Visitor’s Center (2 block walk). After 6 stamps you get a free shirt at the Visitor’s Center.</p>
