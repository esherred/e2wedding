      <p>The story of Eric and Erica, affectionally called E<sup>2</sup>, is like a fairy tale. Not the type most couples want it to be - with magic and fairies and unicorns. The kind with ogres and evil witches and incurable diseases. But as every Disney fan knows, love and the good guys conquer all, and so did they.</p>

      <p>The unlikely pair met while scuba diving in the frigid waters of Lake Rawlings, Virginia. Erica was finishing up her basic certification while Eric was receiving a much fancier Dive Master certification and was assigned to help teach her class. They were briefly introduced and Erica immediately turned to her friend exclaiming "I like him and I don't know why!" That night they stayed up until almost 3AM "discussing" politics over beer and a bonfire.</p>

      <p>After a short weekend where Erica separated her shoulder (and kept it a secret), and a hilariously awkward exchange with Erica's friend trying to play matchmaker, Erica left for home with Eric's email address in hand. Several dates followed, as did a breakup. They remained friends and together they got through some very difficult times that threatened both Eric's life and sanity. After many months, they decided to give their relationship another shot. This time, it stuck.</p>

      <p>Together, they've built a small menagerie of cats, moved to Germany, Florida, Wisconsin, and back to Florida. bought a house, and visited more than a handful of countries around the world. They have no plans to settle down.</p>
